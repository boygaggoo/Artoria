Artoria
=======

Augmented reality app for the Ghent belfry for #oSoc14.


Mixare
=======

The augmented reality engine used is mixare, which can be found at http://www.mixare.org/download/
The part used is the MixView, all other functionality was stripped.


Open Street Map
===============
This app uses Open Street Map. We used OSMDroid ( https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid ) and the OSM bonus pack ( https://code.google.com/p/osmbonuspack/ ) to implement this feature.


How to run
========
Import this project in Android studio, click run and you're good to go.

Don't forget to request an API key from mapquest ( http://developer.mapquest.com/ ) and insert it in res/values/keys.xml
